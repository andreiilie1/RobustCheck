RobustCheck documentation
=========================

RobustnessCheck is a Python package designed for evaluating the robustness of image
classification machine learning models. It provides tooling to apply simple, yet effective
and efficient black-box untargeted adversarial attacks against models that expose a batch
predict function that outputs probability distributions.

* Check out the :doc:`usage` section for getting started, including how to
  :ref:`install <installation>` the package.

* :doc:`metrics` introduces the main robustness metrics that RobustCheck generates.

* :doc:`RobustnessCheck` provides the documentation for the main functionality of our
  package.

* :doc:`dump_metrics` provides the documentation for the functions used to save the
  robustness assessment results.

The black-box, untargeted adversarial attacks used for robustness assessment are EvoBA,
which is a peer-reviewed and published approach [1], and EpsGreedy, which is a variation of
EvoBA following the classic Epsilon-Greedy exploration strategy.

We provide the documentation for the underlying adversarial attacks that RobustCheck uses to
generate the robustness metrics.

``EvoStrategyUniformUntargeted`` and ``EpsilonGreedyUntargeted`` are the adversarial attacks
used by RobustCheck. We provide an abstract class ``UntargetedAttack`` that both of the attacks
implement. Developers interested to extend RobustCheck via the addition of other relevant
adversarial attacks are encouraged to do it by providing new implementations of
``UntargetedAttack``.

We further provide ``EvoStrategy``, a generic abstract class for evolutionary search strategies.
``EvoStrategyUniformUntargeted`` implements both this and ``UntargetedAttack``. We believe that
there are many other evolutionary strategies that would fulfill the efficiency and effectiveness
criteria required by the RobustCheck package, therefore we encourage potential contributors to
consider adding attacks that implement both ``EvoStrategy`` and ``UntargetedAttack``.
